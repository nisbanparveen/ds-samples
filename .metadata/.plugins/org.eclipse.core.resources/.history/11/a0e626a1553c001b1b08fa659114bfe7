/**
 * This solution is for a classic direct stack implementation problem, the
 * balancing of symbols.
 * 
 * We use stacks to check if the given expression has balanced symbols or not.
 * 
 * Algorithm Steps:
 * 
 * 1. Create a Stack 
 * 2. while(end of input is not reached) 
 * 	a. If the character
 * read is not symbol to be balanced, ignore it. 
 * 	b. If the character is opening
 * symbol like (,[,{ then push it onto stack. 
 * 	c. If it is closing symbol like
 * ),],}, if the stack is empty report and error, else pop the stack
 * 	d. If the symbol popped is not the corresponding opening symbol, report error
